	<img class="hero" src="images/about-hero.png" alt="Hi! I am an enthusiastic designer living in New York City with a 
	DEEP PASSION FOR DESIGN. 
	I recently graduated from Syracuse University, College of Visual and Performing Arts, with a BFA in Advertising Design. 
	I am committed to a career in Advertising and Graphic Design.
	My greatest achievement has been receiving a Merit Award from 
	The One Club for an interactive branding campaign 
	(found in my portfolio section). I also contributed to revamping 
	the Syracuse chapter of the AIGA (American Instititue of Graphic Arts), 
	and held the position of president for one year. 
	And lastly, I am 90% fluent in Hebrew 
	which I plan to use in achieving my goal of one day, becoming an international creative.

	Presently, I am ready and willing to work for an ad firm, in-house graphics, or graphic design company. I also love freelance! I feel that through my 
	experiences in college and internships, I have developed my ability as an AMAZING VISUAL THINKER
	and am now ready to put it into action. My 
	OUT-OF-THE-BOX IDEAS 
	are just what the doctor ordered!"/>
